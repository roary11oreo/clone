Rory C Jones is a Ph.D. student in Sociology at Baylor University. His research focuses on spiritual practices, image of God, and distinctives of Christian higher education. Rory's master's thesis uses data from the NSYR to find connections between adult prayer behaviors and adolescent behaviors, attitudes, and relationships. As part of Baylor's PhD program, Rory will be a teacher of record in an introductory sociology course in fall 2021.

Prior to coming to Baylor's Sociology department, Rory earned a B.A. in History and German from Southwestern University and a Master of Divinity from George W. Truett Theological Seminary. Rory spent a year teaching English in Germany as a Fulbright Scholar.
